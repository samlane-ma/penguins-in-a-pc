# penguins-in-a-pc.jpeg
While the preceeding image contains elements belonging to their respective copyright holders that should be respected, the following image **(penguins-in-a-pc.jpeg)** was created using DALL-E 2. I asked for a bunch of penguins in a monitor done in a cartoon style. This is what I got. While it was a spectacular failure of what I was looking for, it was an amazing success in its own right. As is AI Generated art, I claim no copyright on it.
Enjoy as you see fit!
