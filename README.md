I asked for a bunch of penguins in a monitor done in a cartoon style.
This is what I got. While it was a spectacular failure of what I was looking for, it was an amazing success in its own right.
As it is AI Generated art where, at least under the current most commonly accepted US copyright beliefs, it cannot be copyright due to not being human-made, I claim no copyright on it.
Enjoy as you see fit!
